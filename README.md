hello to all readers; i have created a calculator basic website here

i am learning html js and tailwind css
---
i have used tutorial from a youtube channel which was using basic html js and css.

My learning from this

1) use of tailwind with docs
2) js basics especially anaonymous functions
3) use of data-* here as data-num to give value to a button click
4) designing and examining webpage through inspect

there were some issues with js code which i have resolved in this

currently i faced some issues shown below; which i may resolve in future
1) i wanted to avoid eval() function in js which has a lot of security issues so i will try to change them in next commit and use mathjs for same
2) i have used @apply function of tailwind which i wanted to avoid
3) i want to know some better way to access tailwind docs on vs code which i have used here
